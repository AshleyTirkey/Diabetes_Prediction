# Diabetes_Prediction
A ML project done in my second year of college.
I have made a model that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning. This project is done in Python and in this project, we use Support Vector Machine(SVM) model for the prediction.

Dataset used for this model: PIMA Diabetes Dataset 

SVM is one the most important algorithms of supervised learning algorithms in which we feed the data to our machine model and thus the machine model is able to learn and predict certain values. In this case we trained our model with several medical information such as 'Glucose Levels', 'Insulin Level', etc. of the patients along with the information whether the person has diabetes or not.

Workflow of this project:
Dataset->Data Preprocessing->Train Test Split->SVM->Trained SVM Classifier
